    data (list of model.DataArray, or model.DataArray): the data to export.
       Metadata is taken directly from the DA object. If it's a list, a multiple
       page file is created. It must have 5 dimensions in this order: Channel,
       Time, Z, Y, X. However, all the first dimensions of size 1 can be omitted
       (ex: an array of 111YX can be given just as YX, but RGB images are 311YX,
       so must always be 5 dimensions).
    thumbnail (None or numpy.array): Image used as thumbnail for the file. Can be of any
      (reasonable) size. Must be either 2D array (greyscale) or 3D with last
      dimension of length 3 (RGB). As png doesn't support it, it will
      be dropped silently.
