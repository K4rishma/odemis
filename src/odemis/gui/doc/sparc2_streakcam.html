            <li>Limit the pixel intensity to max. 1000 cts/100ms at all times.</li>
            <li>Put the camera in focus mode (unchecked).</li>
            <li>Turn on the calibration light and close the slit of the spectrograph by toggling the manual
                focus button.
                Open the slit and shutter of the streak camera to get the signal in live view. Maximize the intensity
                by moving the focus of the spectrograph manually. If no signal can be found, most likely the
                detector offset is completely off. First roughly adjust the detector offset (see next step)
                and then adjust the spectrograph focus.</li>
            <li>Adjust the spectrograph detector offset by adjusting the offset value based on the horizontal
                position of the spot on the displayed image (change offset using shrkconfig commands in terminal).
                The spot should be centered on the horizontal wavelength axis (0 pixel). Turn the calibration light off by
                untoggling the manual focus button.</li>
            <li>Optional: Perform a fine spectral calibration by toggling the manual focus button,
                selecting a grating and setting the center wavelength. Position the peaks of the calibration
                light (Ar) using the shrkconfig commands in the terminal (see manual: Ar spectrum).</li>
            <li>Turn on the e-beam and find the CL spot by adjusting the Y-direction of the FSLT lens</li>

            <li>Switch on the streak mode (checked).</li>
            <li>Optimize the MCP-Gain and the exposure time until the signal (a spot) is sufficient.</li>
            <li>Choose a smaller time range if multiple spots are visible.</li>
            <li>Center the line by adjusting the trigger delay.</li>
            <li>Perform the same procedure for all higher zoom levels.  </li> <!--Hack: empty space to avoid not empty line-->
            <li>Save the calibration file specifying the e-beam voltage.</li>
